# Content-Based Collaborative Filtering for Movie Recommendation

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Objective

In this project, we will develop a content-based collaborative filtering recommender system tailored for movies. The objective is to implement the system during the lab session, leveraging the power of neural networks to create user and movie vectors. Through this approach, we aim to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of movie recommendations for users based on their preferences and movie characteristics. By the end of this report, we will have successfully explored and implemented the content-based collaborative filtering technique, offering valuable insights into its application in personalized movie recommendation systems.
